A team of 6 people are building an application with Rust. The application is in active development and will be released soon. Rust comes with a linter called Clippy, which the documentation suggests running during CI. It's also recommended to prevent the pipeline from passing if any warnings come up. The version of Clippy which comes with the toolchain already used for compiling should also be used for linting for maximum compatibility.

Rust also has a built-in testing library called cargo test. A crate called cargo-nextest also exists, which claims to be up to 3x faster. Compiling is also done with cargo by running the cargo build command. The Rust documentation has instructions on how to setup a CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.

There seems to be quite a lot of CI/CD platforms other than Jenkins or GitHub Actions, such as GitLab CI, JetBrains TeamCity, Drone.io, CircleCI, KrakenCI or Jenkins X. In this case, GitHub Actions or GitLab CI would probably be the best option depending on which platform the code is already hosted on. Since the team is small, a cloud-based environment will likely be better and cheaper. If the project is really big, and building/testing requires specialized hardware such as a GPU or an excessive amount of memory, then a self-hosted solution should be considered instead.
